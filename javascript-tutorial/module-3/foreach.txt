For Loop
The JavaScript for loop is used to iterate through the array or the elements for a specified number of times. If a certain amount of iteration is known,
 it should be used.

The JavaScript forEach method is one of the several ways to loop through arrays. Each method has different features,
 and it is up to you, depending on what you're doing, to decide which one to use.

forEach loop
The forEach() method is also used to loop through arrays, but it uses a function differently than the classic “for loop”. 
It passes a callback function for each element of an array together with the below parameters:


Current Value (required): The value of the current array element
Index (optional): The index number of the current element
Array (optional): The array object the current element belongs to
We need a callback function to loop through an array by using the forEach method.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

Using the traditional "for loop" to loop through the array would be like this:

for (i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
} 


Firstly, to loop through an array by using the forEach method, you need a callback function (or anonymous function):
 

 numbers.forEach(function() {
    // code
});

The function will be executed for every single element of the array. It must take at least one parameter which represents the elements of an array:

numbers.forEach(function(number) {
    console.log(number);
});
